This is my password generator which based on this algorithm for obtaining a random number:
X[i]=Xmin+(Xmax-Xmin)*U[i]
where U[i] is a random value obtained in the interval from 0 to 1 using the above function. After generation, the random number is converted into a symbol according to the ASCII table.
